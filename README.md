# Feedreader Test Suite

## Installation / Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:katherinebeam/feedreader.git
cd feedreader
open index.html
```

## Learning Purpose

This project provided an understanding of how to use Jasmine to write unit tests for an already-coded JavaScript project. The tests written covered:
* Ensuring certain HTML elements were shown or hidden depending on the triggering of an event
* Ensuring an object had certain properties defined and that the property's value was not blank
* Ensuring an asynchronous function returned a result and changed the content of the page when called
